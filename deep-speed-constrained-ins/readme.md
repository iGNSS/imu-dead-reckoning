# deep-speed-constrained-ins

This folder contains python3 and PyTorch 1.10.2 ported version of https://github.com/AaltoVision/deep-speed-constrained-ins.

Code in here is ugly and my focus was not to train this model but to use it so I did not use my time to clean it up except for changing figure drawing to be done to tensorboard and added other some tensorboard logging.
